App: https://mikebranski.github.io/blochead/

## Roadmap
- Ability to choose overlay image.
- Ability to choose which corner to put the overlay in.
- Prettier design.

## Caveats
- Currently works in Chrome, Firefox, and Edge 13. Safari and IE don't like `<a download="filename">`.
- Image gets rendered as a 300 x 300 pixel square.
